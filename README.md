                Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the
                Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of
                Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering
                injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity. But one hundred years
                later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly
                crippled by the manacles of segregation
                and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of
                poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is
                still languished in the corners of American
                society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we've come here today to dramatize a shameful
                condition.
